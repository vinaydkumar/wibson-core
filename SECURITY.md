# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you think that you have found a security issue in Wibson, please **DO NOT** post it as a Github issue and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all security issues must be sent to developers@wibson.org.
Although we are working on setting up a bug bounty program to improve this, we appreciate your discretion and will give the corresponding credit to the reporter(s).
